>## Build👩‍💻
To create the extension you must download version 1.58.0 of uBlock: 
<br>
https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases/tag/1.58.0 .
<br>
Then drag the files from my repository into it by replacing the manifest.json.
<br>
Then all you have to do is enter your log into the termis.js code and obfuscate it if necessary.
